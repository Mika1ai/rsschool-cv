## Summary
My goal is to become a highly qualified front-end developer. I started to move towards my goal quite recently, 2 months ago I signed up for courses in front-end development from the TeachMeSkills organization. In parallel with this, I learned about the opportunity to study at RS School courses, and of course I took advantage of this. Today I am not good at anything, but I have a great desire to learn how to do this kind of work quickly and efficiently.
